          > ## **Note**
          > There are two image formats that are supported for companies, PNG's and SVG's.
          > You can see which type the original file is by looking at the `file_type` field.
          > We prefer SVG's as they are resolution independent and as such,
          > the width and height are only there to reflect the original asset that was uploaded.
          > An SVG can be scaled properly beyond those dimensions if you call them as a PNG.
          >
          > For more information about how SVG's and PNG's can be used, take a read through
          > [this document](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/images).
